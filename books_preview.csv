AGNSX6W3BDK7CBY7TTVXBMBZ5BMQ,1568331398,1568331398,5.0,"Historically, I always thought of Zane Grey as the quintessential pulp fiction Western scribbler. He may well have been that, but he certainly earned a hefty living doing so in the pre-TV era. More importantly, he was able to indulge a fishing addiction in the grandest of styles. I knew that Grey was a pioneer in developing both the gear and the methods used to land giant swordfish, blue fin tuna and marlin but I had no idea that he wrote so compellingly and lyrically about his quests. For keen fishermen who enjoy reading -- irrespective of the quarry -- Grey's books on the South Pacific (esp.) and big game fishing everywhere else are simply ""must reads"". Even my aged Mom, no fan of fishing, loves reading Grey's descriptions of the surroundings, his battles (more lost than won, and each one reading as a true rendition of the actual event), and the sea itself. I find his prose relaxing, even mesmerizing. (If there are any scuba divers among this audience, reading one of these books is like relaxing on a sunny tropical reef at 40' just listening to the 2nd stage and blowing bubbles. Pure zen.)",False,0,196,41394,Unknown,Books,Tales of Tahitian Waters,5.0,6,18.32,Books

AGPOTH7VZ6ZUYHWA6VKDLFOVD7MA,0887346480,0887346480,4.0,"Not exactly a reference book for historians, this is ideal for the costumer.<br /><br />The patterns are complete and can be adapted to actors' bodies and one reviewer has already noted the variety of men's items:  frockcoats, tailcoats, a variety of trousers (suiting different periods) with a small selection of reference photographs, portraits and fashion plates.<br /><br />What are wanting in this book are the sources for the pictorial references.  Not all the men pictured are noted in the captions (and some are very famous, such as poet Leigh Hunt)), nor are the sources for the images.  In one image from the 1860s, a man obviously in mourning (from the wide band on his top hat, a member of President Lincoln's staff presumably after the assassination) is not stated as such.  To overlook mourning dress in a book about 19th century clothing is an enormous oversight.<br /><br />Also distracting are the rather poor line illustrations in the book.  The human body looks stilted and the proportions are off.  A more competent illustrator would have added more authority to this otherwise quite recommendable guide.",True,4,189,43282,Unknown,Books,Men's Garments 1830-1900: A Guide to Pattern Cutting and Tailoring,4.8,35,39.99,Books

She was the oldest and essentially raised and educated her younger siblings. Jane was bookish and scientific, with an analytical mind. Raven, who worked in the gambling hell owned by Reed Stirling (from the book Rogue to Ruin) was an orphan who was raised in a work house. He was abused and didn't trust anyone. They met in unique circumstances, and Jane's observant eye and curiosity forged a friendship, in the quest to discover Raven's parentage.

It also includes a year's free access to online practice worksheets, which I consider more valuable than the book itself and just as rigorous. Online program keeps cumulative stats of how many practice questions have been done in each category and what percentage was answered correctly. A few minor kinks(which do not alter the 5-star rating): (1)there are occasional typos in online worksheets, (2)online feedback and stats could be improved, (3)when I first registered for online access, the system gave me only 5 months instead of a year and I had to email the company to get it fixed, which they promptly did.",True,3,127,44847,Unknown,Books,"NJ ASK Practice Tests and Online Workbooks: Grade 3 Language Arts and Literacy, Fourth Edition: 2013 Common Core State Standards Aligned",3.5,8,—,Books
