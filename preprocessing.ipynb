         "['Hercules, the leader in mobile DJ controllers for PC/Mac, is proud to unveil its new mixing console for computers, the Hercules DJControl Instinct. The DJControl Instinct is designed for anyone with an instinct for mixing, and for everyone dreaming of getting behind the decks to host great parties with their own music and setting the dance floor on fire.Instinctive, compact and lightweight, DJControl Instinct has been created with all users in mind, and comes equipped with everything needed to start having fun right away – audio outputs, pressure-detecting jog wheels, and intuitive mixing software (DJUCED). All users need to start hosting wild DJ parties is a computer (PC or Mac, with a USB port to connect the controller), a pair of amplified speakers, headphones, and audio files on computer.Thanks to its central mixer with a brushed metal texture, which splits up the controller’s surface in relation to the two lacquered deck areas on either side, DJControl Instinct provides handling that is truly instinctive. The bright orange and red backlighting used for its controls allows users to very easily identify where all of the different elements are, even in low-light conditions. In addition to being simple to use, the controller is also powerful: its two pressure-detecting jog wheels let you scratch without any latency, as well as scroll within tracks, and control the Pitch Bend function.DJControl Instinct is the only controller in its category to feature built-in audio outputs: two RCA outputs, plus one 3.5 mm stereo mini-jack output. This makes it easy for DJs to play their mix on amplified PA system speakers, on a hi-fi system or on multimedia speakers.An independent output in 3.5 mm stereo mini-jack format also lets users connect their headphones, to preview tracks privately before playing them in their mix.

This jack is typically used for headphone monitoring or connecting to a DSLR audio input for recording. The LN2MIC-ZMH4-MON Y-Splitter cable allows you to do both monitoring and recording from a single output jack. It also features a -25dB L Pad attenuator on both audio channels to reduce the Prosumer Line Level output (-10dBV) to your camera's mic input sweet spot level. It's the perfect mating cable for Zoom H4N recorders when connecting to Canon D5 MkII but also works great for other similar mic preamps and DSLR cameras that require 25db of attenuation. The cable is designed with the proper impedances to assure maximum voltage transfer and low noise operation. The cable shield is isolated on the camera end to prevent shield noise from directly coupling into the camera connector ground. The cable allows users to go directly from the audio recorder into the camera and also monitor with headphones, creating a compact and elegant interface solution. All resistors values are 1% metal film to assure similar voltage attenuation between the stereo inputs. Cable ends are labeled for proper connection.\"]",

Compatible with both Windows and Mac OS operating systems, you can simply plug the U37 into your PC and start recording. The U37 has two switches on the front. The first switch allows you to decrease the sensitivity of the microphone so the sound quality is clear for extremely loud sounds. For example, the switch should be in the \"-10\" position for loud voices, percussion and other high sound pressure level devices. The \"0\" position should be used for normal voices and string instruments. The second switch on the U37 is designed to reduce pickup of deep-bass sounds. The switch should be in the \"Normal Bass\" mode in most cases. However, if you want to remove wind noise, ventilation noise, or decrease the low frequencies in a recording, the switch should be in the \"Bass Reduction\" position.', 'From the Manufacturer', 'USB Studio Recording Microphone', 'Record studio-quality audio directly to your computer', 'Record studio-quality audio directly to your computer', 'Excellent for vocals and instruments', 'Excellent for vocals and instruments', 'Podcast over the internet', 'Podcast over the internet', 'Create your own audio for video', 'Create your own audio for video', 'Record your own songs', 'Record your own songs', 'Simply plug in and start recording', 'Simply plug in and start recording', 'Windows and Macintosh compatible', 'Windows and Macintosh compatible', 'Applications', 'Studio Vocals, Speech, Instruments, Podcasts, Desktop Recording', 'U37 Features and Benefits', 'Large condenser microphone element for warm, rich recordings', 'Large condenser microphone element for warm, rich recordings', 'Cardioid pick-up pattern minimizes background noise and isolates the main sound source', 'Cardioid pick-up pattern minimizes background noise and isolates the main sound source', 'Smooth, extended frequency response is excellent for singing, speech and instruments', 'Smooth, extended frequency response is excellent for singing, speech and instruments', '-10dB overload-protection switch minimizes distortion from loud sound sources', '-10dB overload-protection switch minimizes distortion from loud sound sources', 'Bass-reduction switch reduces room noise', 'Bass-reduction switch reduces room noise', 'Side-address design used by broadcast, TV and recording studios', 'Side-address design used by broadcast, TV and recording studios', 'Ten-foot USB cable for flexible mic placement', 'Ten-foot USB cable for flexible mic placement', 'Desktop mic stand included', 'Desktop mic stand included']",
